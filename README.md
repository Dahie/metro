# metro

Metro is a framework built around [gosu](https://github.com/jlnr/gosu) (the 2D game development library in Ruby). The goal of Metro is to enforce common conceptual structures and conventions making it easier to quickly generate a game.

> NOTE: This project is very early in development and at this point mostly a prototype to explore more of theses concepts to gain an understanding of core tools necessary to make games.

Please take a look at the [example game project](https://github.com/burtlo/starry-knight) that I am building alongside of 'metro' to see how it can be used to develop games.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'metro'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install metro

## Usage

```
metro [gamefilename]
```

By default Metro will look for a file named 'metro' within the current working directory if no *gamefilename* has been provided.
